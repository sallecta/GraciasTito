Titocad 0.2.5
=============
The structure of the TVisGraf3D class is improved, so that it allows the execution of commands.
The class TVisGraf3D continues to be reordered.
Simple processing of the LINE command is implemented.

Earrings: Finish implementing the RECTANGLE command, which involves creating a polyline.
You have to check to see which is the best structure to the TobjGrafDXF class.
It would be necessary to implement the mechanism of "Redo", "Undo".
See how it is the best way to structure the objects to draw, since currently only
we have a useful class (TObjGrafDXF) that derives from TObjjGraf.


Titocad 0.2.4
=============
The TVisGraf3D viewer routines are rewritten, creating procedures for each state
of the Viewer. In this way, the code is oriented to the management of states, instead of events,
facilitating maintenance, and expansion.
The event is created to handle status change in the TVisGraf3D viewer.
The code has been reordered and revised considerably, changing some names and
parameters.


Titocad 0.2.3
=============
The selection of lines is improved.
The display of the mouse coordinates in the status bar is activated.
The grid is activated.
Virtual coordinates are defined for the mouse pointer, on the screen.
It modifies the drawing of the control points so that they are not affected by the zoom.

Titocad 0.2.2
=============
The TMotPoint point is created in MotGraf3D and some routines are adapted for its use.
The control of the actions is improved, with the possibility of being able to identify the control
who fired the action.
The drawing routine of the control points is modified so that they appear in perspective.
The selection routine of the control points is modified so that it considers the z axis.
The "position" field of TPtoCtrl is eliminated, as it does not make sense in the new scheme.
The control points created by default in TObjGraf are removed, since in the new
scheme, the objects are very varied and their control points too.
The TPtoCtrl class is modified to adapt it to the new way of working.



Titocad 0.2.1
=============
The object Line enter the graphic objects and become virtual some methods
of ObjGraf.

Titocad 0.2
===========
The architecture of the libraries continues to be adapted to the one described in the model of the
document.
A routine is included to fix the pivot point, always at the center of the screen.
Identification methods are added to the project explorer.
Context menus are completed and a form is created for the properties of
a sight.
The graphic object container is moved to the TCadPagina class.


Titocad 0.1
===========
In this version, the units and the classes of the project are modified, to adapt them
to the architecture planned for the application. Be part of the architecture of the
ogEditGraf library, and it is adapted to the new TitoCad scheme. The
main difference with respect to ogEditGraf, is that the containers of the objects,
they are not part of the editing engine.

A Project Explorer Frame is created.

Titocad 0.0
===========
First version of TitoCad. It is not functional yet.
